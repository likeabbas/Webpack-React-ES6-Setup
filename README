My boilerplate for Webpack, ES6, React (with JSX), Redux and React Router.

Big thanks to Juho Vepsäläinen for getting me setup with this via his book, SurviveJS: Webpack. 

How to use:

Developer Environment: npm run start
- Currently set to http://localhost:2000

Production Environment: npm run build
- Current generated output put into build/
- Bundles all client dependencies into a single Vendor.[hash].js
- All CSS files will need to be specified in the webpack config file. Do not include any CSS files in your JSX/JS files, that code is automatically generated by Webpack.
